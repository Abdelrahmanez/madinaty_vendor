# Navigation

FitRack app uses React Navigation v7 with a nested navigation structure:

- `/src/navigators/index.js` is the main navigation entry point that determines authentication state
- Authentication flow is handled by conditional rendering of either:
  - `AppNavigator.js` - for authenticated users
  - `AuthNavigator.js` - for unauthenticated users
  
## Navigation Service

[NavigationService.js](mdc:src/navigators/NavigationService.js) provides helper functions to navigate from non-component files:

- `setNavigator(ref)` - Sets the navigation ref
- `navigate(name, params)` - Navigate to a screen
- `reset(params, name)` - Reset navigation state
- `getCurrentRoute()` - Get current route information

## Main Screens

- `welcomeScreen` - Initial landing screen
- `loginScreen` - Authentication screen
- `homeScreen` - Main screen after authentication

Always import the NavigationService for navigating outside of components.
